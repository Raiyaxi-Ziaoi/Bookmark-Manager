A customisable bookmark manager made in Python <br/><br/>Made by Raiyaxi Ziaoi and <a href="https://github.com/28add11">Nicholas</a>

The "Main Bookmarks.txt" file contains sample websites and more can be added via the application itself. It is also automatically formatted by the program when you use its built-in bookmark adder.
